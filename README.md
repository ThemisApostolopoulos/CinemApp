## About the app
We came up with the idea for an app about a cinema, where you can book tickets, rate movies , etc.
We had to implement various things that we learned from this subject,such as finding about the requirements of the project,
creating the correct diagrams(ER, Use case diagram) and carrying out various test through Junit.
